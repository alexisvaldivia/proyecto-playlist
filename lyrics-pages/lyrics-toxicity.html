                    Conversion, software version seven point out
                    Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
                    Eating seeds as a past-time activity
                    The toxicity of our city, of our city

                    You, what do you own the world?
                    How do you own disorder, disorder?
                    Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
                    Sacred silence and sleep
                    Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder

                    More wood for the fires, loud neighbors
                    Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
                    Eating seeds as a past-time activity
                    The toxicity of our city, of our city

                    You, what do you own the world?
                    How do you own disorder, disorder
                    Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
                    Sacred silence and sleep
                    Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder

                    You, what do you own the world?
                    How do you own disorder?
                    Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
                    Sacred silence and sleep
                    Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder

                    When I became the Sun
                    I shone life into the man's hearts
                    When I became the Sun
                    I shone life into the man's hearts
